# Railway-Track-Damage-Detection-System
This work introduces a project that aims in designing robust railway crack detection scheme (RRCDS) using TSOP IR RECEIVER SENSOR assembly system which avoids the train accidents by detecting the cracks on railway tracks. And also capable of alerting the authorities in the form of SMS messages along with location by using GPS and GSM modules. The system also includes distance measuring sensor which displays the track deviation distance between the railway track
